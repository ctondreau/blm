                      The uprising spreading across this country is fueled by systemic racial issues that have been ingrained in the fabric of this nation for decades. As weâ€™ve seen over the last few days, these issues have now manifested into anger, sadness, fear, and confusion. Many throughout the country are left to consider at this moment after watching the horrific footage of George Floyd: When is enough, enough?
